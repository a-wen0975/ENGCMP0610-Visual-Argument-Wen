# Introduction

For my visual argument, I’m thinking of creating an advertisement for an Asian snack, suck as a Korean drink called Yakult. It is a well-known drink at least in Asia, but in the states Yakult (along with many other Asian snacks) is not very popular. In the states, we usually see ads for American food and brands, so it’s harder to find out what’s popular in foreign countries. Thus, my target audience is anyone who doesn’t know what yakult is, so that my advertisement would catch their attention to this unique beverage. I’m hoping that my ad would persuade and interest them in buying this product and trying it out if they’ve never tasted it before, or at least be open to it. In a real-world setting, I would imagine people viewing this advertisement popping up on social media platforms or on posters around populated areas, especially where people shop for groceries or gather to eat. The approach I’m thinking right now is to make the product, product name, and some key words stand out at first glance, while using bright and aesthetic colors that are pleasing to the eye to also draw people’s attention. I don't want too much going on to the point where the product gets drowned in the noise, while also having some added visuals to aid the message and persuasion effect.
